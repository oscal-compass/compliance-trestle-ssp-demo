## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a.\] Develops, documents, and disseminates to executives:

  - \[2.\] Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the access control policy and associated access controls; and

- \[b.\] Reviews and updates the current:

  - \[1.\] Access control policy monthly; and
  - \[2.\] Access control procedures weekly.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[AC-1(a)\]

  - \[AC-1(a)(1)\]

    - \[AC-1(a)(1)[1]\] develops and documents an access control policy that addresses:

      - \[AC-1(a)(1)[1][a]\] purpose;
      - \[AC-1(a)(1)[1][b]\] scope;
      - \[AC-1(a)(1)[1][c]\] roles;
      - \[AC-1(a)(1)[1][d]\] responsibilities;
      - \[AC-1(a)(1)[1][e]\] management commitment;
      - \[AC-1(a)(1)[1][f]\] coordination among organizational entities;
      - \[AC-1(a)(1)[1][g]\] compliance;

    - \[AC-1(a)(1)[2]\] defines personnel or roles to whom the access control policy are to be disseminated;
    - \[AC-1(a)(1)[3]\] disseminates the access control policy to organization-defined personnel or roles;

  - \[AC-1(a)(2)\]

    - \[AC-1(a)(2)[1]\] develops and documents procedures to facilitate the implementation of the access control policy and associated access control controls;
    - \[AC-1(a)(2)[2]\] defines personnel or roles to whom the procedures are to be disseminated;
    - \[AC-1(a)(2)[3]\] disseminates the procedures to organization-defined personnel or roles;

- \[AC-1(b)\]

  - \[AC-1(b)(1)\]

    - \[AC-1(b)(1)[1]\] defines the frequency to review and update the current access control policy;
    - \[AC-1(b)(1)[2]\] reviews and updates the current access control policy with the organization-defined frequency;

  - \[AC-1(b)(2)\]

    - \[AC-1(b)(2)[1]\] defines the frequency to review and update the current access control procedures; and
    - \[AC-1(b)(2)[2]\] reviews and updates the current access control procedures with the organization-defined frequency.

## Control acme_guidance

Access control documentation should be at one centrally managed intranet site that is consistent across the corporation. Website should be indexed in intranet search engine.

## Control guidance

This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the AC family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures.
